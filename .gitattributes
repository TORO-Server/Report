# Handle line endings automatically for files detected as text
# and leave all files detected as binary untouched.
* text=auto

# Check out text files with LF, commit with LF
# This enforces LF ending in the repository and on checkout
# If the user is on Windows and wants CRLF locally but LF in repo, 
# 'text=auto' usually handles normalization, but specific forcing can be better for consistency.
# However, usually regarding "unifying", forcing LF is common in cross-platform projects.
# Let's use text eol=lf to force LF locally and remotely if that's the "unification" goal.
# But standard Git behavior 'text=auto' is safer for mixed environments unless strictly LF is desired everywhere.
# Given "consistency", often people want LF everywhere.

* text=auto eol=lf

# Explicitly declare text files to ensure they are normalized
